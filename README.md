## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The filteration gave me some trouble at first and after multiple tries I decided to store the selected filter items in an object and filter the json data based on that.

### Continued development

I want to continue exploring javascript filteration and search coding and learning more.
